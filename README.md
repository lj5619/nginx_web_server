NGINX is a high-performance, open-source web server and reverse proxy server that is widely used for serving static content, load balancing, and handling high-traffic websites. Developed by Igor Sysoev, NGINX is known for its efficiency, scalability, and flexibility. For this project, we utilized AWS by deploying an Amazon EC2 instance to host and manage the NGINX server. We selected an appropriate EC2 instance type based on our resource requirements and configured it with a secure and accessible setup. By installing NGINX on this EC2 instance, we were able to serve a custom HTML page with a black background and white text, showcasing our teamâ€™s contribution. AWS provided the scalable and reliable infrastructure necessary to ensure the NGINX server performed efficiently, while the EC2 instance facilitated remote access and management of the web server. This approach demonstrated the practical use of cloud computing resources to deploy and manage web services effectively.
